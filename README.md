## Use & Installation

After making a local clone of this repo, run npm install and then npm start to get the server running. You'll need to run MongoDB locally, and there are two environmental variables that you'll need to add to a .env file. The first is the JWT_SECRET which can be any string that you'd like. And the second optional variable is TEST_DATABASE_URL if you'd like the tests to be executed somewhere other than your local database. You can see all config variables in the config.js file in the root directory.
